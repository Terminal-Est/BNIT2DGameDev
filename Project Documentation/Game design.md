Game design test upload

Initial game mechanics, concepts and storyline. Just a draft at this point.

Game Name - ???


Concept
Pizza delivery with GTA-styled twist. Main character will drive to various destinations to deliver 
items of interest whilst avoiding the law and other enemy players/rival pizza company employees.
At the destination, the main character will face obstacles and enemy AI to reach delivery destination.
The main character, through progression, can be upgraded (vehicles included) to combat more difficult
missions.


Game mechanics & rules
1. Top down platform (outside buildings/locations)
	- Top down restricted to players operating vehicles
	- Driving on roads only (buildings/locations indestructible)
	- Limited to car weapons
	- Places of interest (POI) with icons (drive in or click icon to access)
	- Locked areas/locked places (progress missions to unlock)
	- AI bots

2. Side scroll platform (inside buildings/locations)
	- Side scroll restricted to player character
	- Character movement
	- 

3. Cutscenes
	- Either: 
		voice over with art OR
		written dialogue (assumed script for main character) with art + sound effects

Starts at pizza shops. Later missions can start at POI.

Random cars (Standby AI) present on road to create traffic/obstacles that main 
character will weave/dodge. As game progresses, main character will encounter enemies (AI or other players?)
which he will avoid detection (character wanted and cops present on road, rival 'pizza store' employees) or
'guns-blazing' where MC will use weapons while driving to destroy obstacles.

Additional!: Added timer for missions (scope creep?)
